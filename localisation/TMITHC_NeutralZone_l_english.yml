NEU_Axis_Infiltration_desc:0 "Yakuza and SS are secretly operating in our country."
NEU_Anarchy:0 "Anarchy"
NEU_Anarchy_desc:0 "After the end of World War II, the United States was partitioned between the two Axis powers. To maintain peace between the two victorious nations, they left a sliver of land in the rocky mountains to act as a buffer zone. A neutral zone. At the peace conference, the delegation representing the former US was not allowed to use any sort of US flag or symbol, and that message carries forth to this day. We have no government. We have no laws and if we did, no way to enforce them. We are in anarchy."
NEU_No_Established_Industry:0 "No Established Industry"
NEU_No_Established_Industry_desc:0 "When the Axis powers left us in the Rocky Mountains, they left us useless land. Much of the ground is unforgiving and unable to be built upon, and what industry we have left over from WW2 is insufficient at best. These factors drastically hinder our ability to effectively construct buildings."
NEU_No_Army:0 "No Army"
NEU_No_Army_desc:0 "Many of the former American high command staff was incinerated in the nuke of Washington.  Many of the lower commanders were either killed or defected to the Nazi SS. As such, our military command is much to be desired, and considering the power of the surrounding nations, not many are willing to volunteer to the cause."
